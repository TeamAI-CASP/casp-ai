Here's an updated Markdown documentation outline, covering the additional features for **Chat Configurations** with **OpenAI's ChatGPT**, **Google Gemini**, and **CASP’s fine-tuning capabilities**. This documentation also includes information on available open-source models and specialized Deepsek models. I have added sections for each feature and included placeholders for screenshots.
